          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">The choice between wood framing and steel framing is one of the most consequential decisions in commercial construction. It affects your budget, your timeline, your environmental footprint, and ultimately the long-term performance of the building. In 2026, this decision is more nuanced than ever, with advances in mass timber technology, evolving building codes, and shifting market economics reshaping the competitive landscape between these two dominant structural systems. Whether you are a general contractor pricing a multi-family project, a developer evaluating feasibility, or an architect exploring structural options, this guide provides the comprehensive comparison you need to make an informed decision.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Cost Comparison: Wood Framing Delivers Significant Savings</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Cost is often the primary driver in the wood-versus-steel decision, and the numbers continue to favor wood framing for the majority of commercial building types. In 2026, wood framing for commercial buildings typically costs between $8 and $14 per square foot for structural framing, while comparable steel framing runs between $12 and $22 per square foot. That translates to material savings of 20 to 35 percent when choosing wood, a margin that can represent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a mid-size multi-family or mixed-use project.</p>

          <!-- AEO Capsule -->
          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Wood framing for commercial buildings costs $8 to $14 per square foot in 2026, compared to $12 to $22 per square foot for steel framing. Wood framing typically saves 20 to 35 percent on material costs and 15 to 25 percent on overall construction timelines, making it the preferred choice for buildings up to five stories.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">But the savings extend well beyond material costs alone. Wood framing requires lighter, less expensive equipment on site. A wood-framed building does not need the heavy cranes and specialized rigging equipment that steel erection demands. Foundation requirements are typically less substantial for wood-framed structures because wood weighs roughly one-fifth as much as steel per unit of structural capacity. On a typical four-story multi-family building, the reduced foundation requirements alone can save $2 to $4 per square foot compared to steel.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Labor costs also favor wood. The skilled labor pool for wood framing is significantly larger than for structural steel erection and welding. In 2026, with construction labor markets remaining tight across most regions, this availability advantage translates directly into lower labor rates and fewer schedule delays caused by workforce shortages. US Framing International maintains crews of experienced production framers who work exclusively in commercial wood construction, enabling us to deliver consistent pricing and predictable schedules.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Speed of Construction: Wood Framing Wins the Schedule Race</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Time is money in commercial construction, and wood framing consistently delivers faster build times than steel. For mid-rise buildings in the three-to-five-story range, wood framing typically completes 15 to 25 percent faster than equivalent steel construction. On a 200-unit apartment building, that schedule compression can mean two to four months of accelerated delivery, translating directly into earlier revenue generation for the developer and reduced carrying costs on construction financing.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Several factors drive this speed advantage. Wood framing does not require the extensive shop drawing and fabrication lead times that structural steel demands. While a steel package may need 12 to 16 weeks from approval to delivery, lumber and engineered wood products are typically available with lead times of two to four weeks. Pre-fabrication capabilities further accelerate the process. Wall panels, floor trusses, and roof systems can be built in controlled factory environments and delivered to the site ready for installation, reducing field labor by 20 to 30 percent on many projects.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Wood framing also allows trades to begin follow-on work sooner. Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing rough-in can start in completed sections of a wood-framed building while framing continues on other sections, whereas steel structures often require the entire structural frame to be completed and inspected before interior trades can begin their work efficiently. This overlap in the construction sequence is a major contributor to the overall schedule advantage of wood framing.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Structural Performance: Strength Where It Counts</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">One of the most persistent misconceptions in commercial construction is that wood cannot match the structural performance of steel. The reality is more nuanced. Wood has an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, meaning that pound for pound, wood is remarkably strong in both tension and compression. Dimensional lumber, engineered wood products like laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and parallel strand lumber (PSL), and manufactured components like wood trusses and I-joists provide reliable, code-compliant structural solutions for a wide range of commercial building types.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">For buildings up to five stories, which fall under Type V and Type III construction classifications in the International Building Code, wood framing provides all the structural capacity needed. The vast majority of multi-family residential buildings, hotels, assisted living facilities, student housing, and mixed-use developments in this height range are built with wood framing. In seismic zones, wood-framed buildings actually offer a significant advantage: the natural flexibility of wood connections allows the structure to absorb and dissipate earthquake energy more effectively than rigid steel connections. This flexibility reduces the forces transmitted to the foundation and minimizes structural damage during seismic events.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Engineered wood products have further expanded the capabilities of wood framing. Glulam beams can span open spaces that were previously achievable only with steel, supporting clear spans of 40 feet or more in commercial applications. Floor trusses engineered for specific load requirements deliver the performance of engineered steel joists at a fraction of the cost, with the added benefit of open webs that accommodate mechanical, electrical, and plumbing runs without the need for penetrations.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Fire Resistance: Modern Assemblies Deliver Proven Performance</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Fire resistance is perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of wood construction. Many people assume that because wood is combustible, wood-framed buildings are inherently less safe in a fire than steel-framed buildings. This assumption does not hold up under scrutiny. Modern fire-rated wood framing assemblies achieve one-hour and two-hour fire resistance ratings that meet or exceed code requirements for virtually every commercial building type where wood construction is permitted.</p>

          <!-- AEO Capsule -->
          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Modern wood framing achieves 1-hour and 2-hour fire resistance ratings through UL-tested assemblies using Type X gypsum, fire-blocking, and sprinkler systems. Mass timber develops a protective char layer in fire that insulates the structural core, maintaining load-bearing capacity longer than unprotected steel, which loses strength at 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">These fire ratings are achieved through tested and listed assemblies that combine wood framing members with gypsum board, fire-blocking materials, and automatic sprinkler systems. UL-listed wall assemblies using standard 2x6 wood studs with two layers of 5/8-inch Type X gypsum board on each side achieve a two-hour fire resistance rating. Floor-ceiling assemblies using wood trusses with proper gypsum protection and resilient channel installations achieve similar ratings. These assemblies have been tested extensively and perform reliably in real-world fire events.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Interestingly, unprotected steel actually loses structural capacity more quickly than heavy timber in a fire. Steel begins to lose significant strength at approximately 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and at 1,500 degrees, structural steel retains only about 20 percent of its room-temperature strength. Heavy timber and mass timber elements, by contrast, develop a protective char layer when exposed to fire. This char layer acts as an insulator, slowing the rate of combustion and protecting the structural core of the member. The result is that heavy timber beams and columns maintain their load-bearing capacity for extended periods during a fire, often outperforming unprotected steel.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Sustainability: Wood Framing Is the Clear Environmental Leader</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">In an era of increasing environmental consciousness and regulatory pressure to reduce embodied carbon in buildings, wood framing holds a decisive advantage over steel. Wood is the only major structural material that is renewable. Trees harvested for construction lumber are replanted and regrown on managed timberlands, creating a sustainable cycle of production that does not deplete finite resources. In the United States, forest growth has exceeded harvest by more than 40 percent annually for over six decades.</p>

          <!-- AEO Capsule -->
          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Wood framing is significantly more sustainable than steel. Wood sequesters approximately one ton of carbon dioxide per cubic meter, requires 75 percent less energy to produce than steel, and is the only major structural material that is renewable. Substituting wood for steel in a typical multi-family building reduces embodied carbon by 40 to 60 percent.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The embodied energy comparison is stark. Manufacturing structural steel requires approximately 24 megajoules of energy per kilogram, while producing dimensional lumber requires roughly 6 megajoules per kilogram, a factor of four difference. Beyond energy consumption, wood actively removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as trees grow, and that carbon remains sequestered in the wood products for the life of the building. One cubic meter of wood stores approximately one ton of carbon dioxide. A typical wood-framed apartment building sequesters hundreds of tons of carbon, essentially turning the structure into a long-term carbon bank.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">These environmental advantages are increasingly recognized by green building rating systems. LEED v4.1 awards credits for building lifecycle impact reduction, where wood framing consistently outperforms steel. The newly adopted ASHRAE 189.1-2023 standard includes embodied carbon limits that are more easily achieved with wood construction. Several cities and states have adopted or are considering buy-clean policies that require Environmental Product Declarations and set maximum global warming potential thresholds for structural materials, further strengthening the case for wood.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">When to Choose Wood vs Steel: A Decision Framework</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The right structural material depends on the specific requirements of your project. Wood framing is the optimal choice for buildings up to five stories where Type V or Type III construction is permitted by code. This encompasses the vast majority of multi-family residential, hospitality, senior living, student housing, and mixed-use developments. Wood is also preferred when budget optimization is a priority, when schedule compression is critical, and when sustainability goals or green building certification are part of the project requirements.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Steel framing becomes the preferred option for buildings exceeding the height and area limits of wood construction types, for facilities with extreme live loads or vibration requirements, for buildings requiring very long clear spans exceeding 60 feet, and for projects in jurisdictions where local amendments restrict wood construction beyond code minimums. Industrial facilities, large retail spaces, and high-rise buildings are typical applications where steel is the appropriate structural system. Many projects benefit from a hybrid approach, using concrete podiums with wood-framed upper stories or steel moment frames in specific locations to address point loads or lateral force requirements within an otherwise wood-framed building.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Multi-Family Sweet Spot: Why Wood Dominates</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The three-to-five-story multi-family market is wood framing's strongest territory, and for good reason. The economics are compelling: a 200-unit garden-style apartment community built with wood framing typically costs $15 to $25 million less than an equivalent steel-framed project. The construction timeline is two to four months shorter. The building achieves equivalent or superior energy performance with standard insulation strategies. And the environmental impact is dramatically lower.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The design flexibility of wood framing is another critical advantage in multi-family construction. Wood framing readily accommodates the varied unit layouts, angled walls, bay windows, and architectural details that differentiate competitive multi-family projects. Modifications and changes during construction are simpler and less costly with wood than with steel, providing developers and architects with greater flexibility to respond to market feedback and leasing requirements. US Framing International has framed over ten million square feet of multi-family space, and our experience confirms that wood framing delivers the optimal balance of cost, speed, quality, and design freedom for this building type.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">CLT and Mass Timber: The Game Changer Extending Wood's Reach</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Cross-laminated timber (CLT) and other mass timber products are transforming what is possible with wood construction. These engineered wood products, which consist of multiple layers of lumber bonded together under pressure, achieve structural capacities comparable to concrete and steel while retaining all the environmental and aesthetic advantages of wood. The 2021 International Building Code, now adopted in most jurisdictions, introduced three new construction types for mass timber buildings: Type IV-A, IV-B, and IV-C. These classifications permit mass timber buildings of up to 18 stories, with some jurisdictions approving projects exceeding 20 stories under performance-based design approaches.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The mass timber market is growing rapidly. Manufacturing capacity in North America has expanded significantly, with new CLT plants in Oregon, Washington, Arkansas, Alabama, and British Columbia coming online between 2023 and 2026. This expanded supply is driving costs down, making mass timber increasingly competitive with structural steel for buildings in the six-to-twelve-story range. Projects like the 25-story Ascent tower in Milwaukee and the 18-story Brock Commons at the University of British Columbia have demonstrated the viability of tall wood buildings, and dozens of mass timber commercial projects are now under construction across the United States.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">For developers and general contractors, mass timber offers a unique value proposition: the speed and environmental benefits of wood construction at scales previously reserved for concrete and steel. Mass timber panels arrive on site prefabricated and ready for installation, enabling extremely fast erection sequences. The Brock Commons project in Vancouver erected 18 stories of mass timber structure in just 70 days. This level of prefabrication and speed is reshaping the competitive dynamics for mid-rise and tall buildings, creating opportunities for developers willing to explore this innovative structural system.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Making the Right Choice for Your Project</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The wood-versus-steel decision ultimately comes down to aligning your structural system with your project's specific requirements for cost, schedule, performance, sustainability, and code compliance. For the vast majority of commercial buildings under six stories, wood framing delivers superior value across every meaningful metric. For taller buildings, mass timber is rapidly expanding the range of projects where wood is the optimal choice. And for applications that genuinely require steel's unique capabilities, the right answer is steel, sometimes in combination with wood in a hybrid structure.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">At US Framing International, we specialize in making wood framing work for complex commercial projects.
