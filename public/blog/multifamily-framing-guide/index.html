          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">Multi-family housing is the backbone of American residential construction, and wood framing is the structural system that makes the vast majority of it possible. From garden-style apartment communities to five-story podium buildings in urban centers, wood-framed multi-family buildings house millions of Americans and represent the largest single segment of the commercial construction market. At US Framing International, multi-family wood framing is our core business. As the nation's largest multi-family wood framing group, we have built our reputation on delivering complex multi-family projects efficiently, safely, and to the highest quality standards. This guide distills decades of that experience into a comprehensive resource for general contractors, developers, architects, and anyone involved in multi-family construction.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Why Wood Dominates Multi-Family Construction</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Wood framing commands an overwhelming share of the multi-family market for buildings of five stories and under, and the reasons go beyond simple cost savings. While wood's cost advantage over steel and concrete is significant, typically 20 to 35 percent lower for the structural system, it is the combination of cost, speed, design flexibility, and workforce availability that makes wood the clear winner for multi-family developers.</p>

            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Wood framing is preferred for multi-family buildings because it costs 20 to 35 percent less than steel or concrete structural systems, constructs 15 to 25 percent faster, offers superior design flexibility for varied unit layouts, and has a much larger available workforce. Over 90 percent of multi-family buildings five stories and under use wood framing.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Speed to market is critical in multi-family development. Every month a project sits under construction rather than generating rental income represents lost revenue and additional carrying costs on construction loans. Wood framing compresses construction schedules significantly. A 200-unit wood-framed apartment building can typically be dried in and ready for interior trades two to four months sooner than an equivalent steel or concrete structure. That time savings translates to hundreds of thousands of dollars in avoided interest costs and accelerated lease-up revenue.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Design flexibility is another critical factor. Multi-family buildings require a wide variety of unit types and configurations within a single structure: studios, one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, and three-bedrooms, often with multiple floor plan options for each type. Wood framing accommodates these variations easily. Moving a wall, adding a bay window, creating an offset in a corridor, or adjusting unit sizes to respond to market demand during design development is straightforward with wood framing. These modifications would be significantly more expensive and time-consuming with steel or concrete structural systems.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Multi-Family Building Types: Understanding Your Options</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Multi-family wood-framed buildings come in several distinct building types, each with its own structural requirements, code considerations, and market positioning. Understanding these building types is essential for making informed decisions about project design and construction approach.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Garden-style apartments</strong> are the most common multi-family building type in the United States. These are typically two-to-three-story buildings arranged around surface parking and landscaped courtyards. Garden-style construction is straightforward: wood-framed bearing walls on a concrete slab-on-grade or crawlspace foundation, with wood truss roof systems. The simplicity of this building type allows for highly efficient production framing, and the lower height means lighter structural loads and simpler lateral force resistance systems. Garden-style communities of 200 to 500 units remain the bread and butter of the multi-family market in suburban and secondary markets.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Podium buildings</strong>, also known as wood-over-concrete or pedestal buildings, stack three to five stories of wood-framed residential above a concrete podium level that typically contains parking, retail, or amenity space. This building type is increasingly popular in urban and first-ring suburban markets where land costs are high and structured parking is required. The concrete podium provides the non-combustible base required by code for taller buildings, while the wood-framed upper floors deliver the cost and speed advantages that make the project financially feasible. Podium construction requires careful coordination between the concrete contractor and the wood framer, particularly at the podium-to-wood transition level where waterproofing, fire separation, and structural load paths all converge.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Wrap buildings</strong> feature wood-framed residential units wrapped around a concrete parking structure. The wood-framed residential floors are not stacked above the parking but rather surround it on three or four sides, creating a courtyard configuration with parking concealed behind the residential facade. This building type is popular in markets where above-grade parking is needed but the developer wants to avoid the visual impact of an exposed parking structure. Wrap construction presents unique framing challenges, including complex connections between the wood-framed residential and the concrete parking structure, and fire separation requirements at the interface.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Townhome clusters and stacked flats</strong> round out the multi-family wood framing landscape. Townhomes offer the feel of single-family living in a multi-family context, with individual entries and two-to-three-story units sharing party walls. Stacked flats are two-story buildings where one unit is above another, each with its own entrance. Both building types use standard wood framing techniques but require careful attention to party wall fire ratings, sound transmission control, and individual unit structural independence.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Code Considerations: Navigating IBC Requirements</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Building code compliance is the framework within which all multi-family framing decisions are made. The International Building Code classifies buildings by construction type, and the two construction types most relevant to multi-family wood framing are Type V and Type III.</p>

          <!-- AEO Capsule -->
          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Multi-family wood framing falls under IBC Type V construction (wood framing throughout, up to 4 stories) or Type III construction (non-combustible exterior walls with wood interior framing, up to 5 stories). With NFPA 13 sprinkler systems, allowable height and area increase significantly, and the 2021 IBC permits mass timber buildings up to 18 stories under Type IV classifications.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Type V construction</strong> permits combustible materials, including wood, for both the structural frame and exterior walls. Type V-A (one-hour rated) and Type V-B (unrated) are the most common classifications for garden-style and smaller multi-family buildings. Under the IBC, Type V-A construction for R-2 (residential) occupancy allows buildings up to four stories and 24,000 square feet per floor without sprinklers. With an NFPA 13 automatic sprinkler system, the allowable height increases to five stories and the allowable area per floor increases to 36,000 square feet. Given that virtually all multi-family buildings of any significant size include sprinkler systems, these sprinklered limits define the practical envelope for Type V multi-family construction.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Type III construction</strong> requires non-combustible exterior walls, which in practice means masonry, concrete, or steel-framed exterior walls, while permitting wood framing for all interior structural elements including floor and roof assemblies, interior bearing walls, and non-bearing partitions. Type III-A construction allows R-2 buildings up to five stories and 28,500 square feet per floor without sprinklers, increasing to six stories and 42,750 square feet with sprinklers. The non-combustible exterior wall requirement adds cost compared to Type V, but the increased height and area limits make Type III the preferred classification for larger urban multi-family projects where maximizing density is essential to project economics.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Design Phase: Why Early Framing Involvement Matters</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">One of the most significant opportunities to improve the cost and schedule performance of a multi-family project is engaging the framing contractor during the design phase, well before construction documents are complete. Early involvement of an experienced framing partner brings practical construction knowledge into the design process, enabling value engineering decisions that can save hundreds of thousands of dollars without compromising the building's performance or aesthetics.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">At US Framing International, our pre-construction team reviews architectural and structural drawings during design development to identify opportunities for optimization. Common value engineering findings include rationalizing bearing wall layouts to reduce the number of point loads and headers, standardizing floor truss depths across the building to simplify procurement and installation, aligning shear wall locations to minimize hold-down requirements, and adjusting unit dimensions to work with standard lumber lengths and minimize waste.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">BIM coordination is another critical benefit of early framing involvement. Using MiTek's advanced BIM platform, our team creates detailed three-dimensional models of the framing system that integrate with the architect's and engineer's models. This coordination identifies conflicts between framing members and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems before they become field problems. On a typical multi-family project, BIM coordination resolves dozens of conflicts that would otherwise result in costly field modifications, schedule delays, and RFIs during construction.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Pre-Construction Advantage: Budgeting and Procurement Strategy</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Lumber is a commodity, and its price fluctuates significantly over time. In the past five years, framing lumber prices have experienced swings of more than 200 percent from trough to peak. For a multi-family project where lumber costs can represent $2 million to $8 million of the budget, these price movements can make the difference between a profitable project and one that struggles financially. Effective lumber procurement strategy is therefore a critical component of multi-family project management.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">US Framing International's national purchasing volume gives us significant leverage in the lumber market. We maintain relationships with mills and distributors across the country, enabling us to source materials at competitive prices even during periods of tight supply. Our pre-construction team provides clients with detailed material quantity takeoffs during budgeting, identifies opportunities to lock in pricing on long-lead materials, and advises on procurement timing based on market conditions. For large projects, we can structure phased material deliveries that align with the construction schedule, reducing on-site storage requirements and minimizing weather exposure of materials.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Production Framing: The JMP Methodology</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Production framing for multi-family buildings is a fundamentally different discipline than custom residential or small commercial framing. The scale and repetitive nature of multi-family projects demand a systematic, production-oriented approach that optimizes crew deployment, material flow, and quality control across hundreds of identical or similar units. US Framing International's Job Management Process, or JMP methodology, is our proprietary system for managing this complexity.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">JMP begins with detailed production planning before the first wall panel is stood. Our project managers create sequencing plans that break each building into discrete work zones, each assigned to a specific crew with a specific scope and timeline. Material deliveries are coordinated to arrive just ahead of each crew's needs, minimizing on-site material storage and reducing the risk of damage, theft, or weather exposure. Quality checkpoints are built into the production sequence at critical milestones: layout verification before wall panels are stood, plumb and line checks before sheathing, bearing point verification before trusses are set, and sheathing nailing pattern inspection before the building is dried in.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Crew deployment follows a wave pattern on large multi-family projects. The first wave handles layout and first-floor wall framing. A second wave follows behind to frame upper floors. A third wave handles roof truss installation and sheathing. And a fourth wave manages exterior sheathing and weather barrier installation. This wave approach keeps each crew focused on the work they do best, maximizes labor efficiency, and compresses the overall schedule by allowing multiple activities to proceed simultaneously across different sections of the building.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Fire-Rated Assemblies: Meeting Code with Confidence</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Fire-rated assemblies are a critical component of every multi-family wood-framed building. The IBC requires fire-resistance-rated separations between dwelling units, between dwelling units and corridors, between floors, and at various other locations within the building. These rated assemblies must be constructed exactly as tested and listed to provide the required fire resistance, and errors in their construction can compromise the safety of the building and create significant liability exposure.</p>

          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Fire-rated assemblies in multi-family wood buildings use UL-listed configurations of wood studs, Type X gypsum board, and insulation to achieve 1-hour and 2-hour fire ratings. Key assemblies include party walls between units, floor-ceiling assemblies between stories, corridor walls, shaft walls for stair and elevator enclosures, and draftstopping in concealed spaces.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Party walls</strong> between dwelling units are the most common fire-rated assembly in multi-family construction. These one-hour-rated assemblies typically consist of wood studs with one or two layers of 5/8-inch Type X gypsum board on each side, depending on the specific UL listing. The assembly must be continuous from the floor structure to the underside of the floor or roof structure above, and all penetrations must be properly sealed with firestop materials. US Framing International's crews are trained to build party walls to the exact specifications of the applicable UL listing, and our quality control program includes inspection of every party wall assembly before it is concealed.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Floor-ceiling assemblies</strong> between stories of multi-family buildings require one-hour fire resistance ratings in most configurations. These assemblies combine the wood floor framing system, typically wood trusses or I-joists, with gypsum board ceilings, subfloor materials, and insulation to achieve the required rating. Resilient channel installation is a critical component of many UL-listed floor-ceiling assemblies, both for fire resistance and for sound transmission control. The channels must be installed at the correct spacing, with the correct fastener type and spacing, and with the correct orientation, as deviations from the listed configuration can void the fire rating.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Shaft walls</strong> for stair enclosures, elevator shafts, and mechanical chases require two-hour fire resistance ratings. These assemblies use proprietary shaft wall systems that combine steel C-studs, multiple layers of gypsum board including specialty products like gypsum liner panels, and specific taping and finishing requirements. Shaft walls are among the most complex fire-rated assemblies in multi-family construction, and their proper installation requires specialized knowledge and attention to detail. <strong>Draftstopping</strong> in concealed floor and attic spaces is another critical fire safety requirement. The IBC mandates that concealed spaces in floor-ceiling and attic assemblies be divided into areas not exceeding 1,000 square feet in buildings with dwelling units. This draftstopping prevents the spread of fire and smoke through concealed spaces and must be installed with the same care as other fire-rated assemblies.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Common Challenges and Proven Solutions</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Multi-family wood framing at scale presents predictable challenges that experienced framing contractors address proactively. <strong>Lumber quality variation</strong> is an ongoing reality. Even within a single delivery, dimensional lumber varies in moisture content, straightness, and grade. Our crews are trained to identify and cull defective material, and our relationships with lumber suppliers include quality standards that minimize the frequency of substandard deliveries. We also maintain material buffers on site to ensure that production is never held up waiting for replacement material.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Weather delays</strong> are an unavoidable factor in wood framing, particularly for multi-story buildings where the framing is exposed to the elements during construction. Our JMP methodology addresses weather risk through aggressive dry-in scheduling, prioritizing roof installation and exterior sheathing to get each building section weathertight as quickly as possible. On large projects, we coordinate with the general contractor to sequence buildings so that dry-in proceeds continuously even when weather interrupts framing on exposed sections.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Coordination with other trades</strong> is perhaps the most complex ongoing challenge on multi-family projects. Framing interacts with virtually every other trade on the project: concrete for foundations and podiums, mechanical for ductwork chases and equipment pads, plumbing for waste lines and vent stacks, electrical for panel locations and conduit runs, and fire sprinkler for riser rooms and main routing. Our project managers participate actively in trade coordination meetings and maintain detailed schedules that account for these interdependencies. When conflicts arise, and they always do on complex multi-family projects, our team works collaboratively with the general contractor and other trades to find solutions that keep the project on schedule.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Case Study: 450-Unit Multi-Family Development</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">A recent 450-unit multi-family development illustrates how US Framing International's approach delivers results on large, complex projects. The project consisted of twelve separate buildings across a 28-acre site, including eight three-story garden-style buildings, two four-story podium buildings over concrete parking, and two townhome buildings. Total framed area exceeded 620,000 square feet, with an overall schedule requirement of fourteen months from first layout to final dry-in.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our pre-construction team engaged during design development and identified over $380,000 in value engineering savings through bearing wall optimization, truss depth standardization, and shear wall rationalization. During construction, we deployed up to sixty-five framers across three concurrent building starts, using our wave production system to maintain steady progress across all active buildings. Despite two months of above-average rainfall during the framing period, we completed dry-in on all twelve buildings within the fourteen-month schedule.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Quality performance was equally strong. Our final inspection pass rate exceeded 97 percent, meaning that 97 percent of all framing inspections passed on the first attempt. Fire-rated assembly inspections achieved a 99 percent first-pass rate. The general contractor on the project reported that our framing quality and schedule performance were among the best they had experienced on a project of this scale, and the developer has since awarded US Framing International three additional projects based on this performance.</p>
