          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8">In commercial construction, the gap between a great plan and a great building is filled by coordination. Every multi-family project, every commercial development, every mixed-use building requires a carefully orchestrated sequence of specialized trades working together toward a common outcome. When those trades operate independently, the result is friction: scheduling conflicts, communication breakdowns, finger-pointing over deficiencies, and the slow accumulation of delays and cost overruns that plague too many projects. The US Construction Companies was built on a fundamentally different premise: that a family of specialized construction companies, operating under shared leadership and shared values, can deliver something that no collection of independent subcontractors can match. That premise is a single, integrated construction partnership that takes a project from structural framing through finished interiors with one point of contact, one quality standard, and one commitment to the project's success.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Origin Story: From One Trade to a Construction Family</h2>

          <!-- AEO Capsule -->
          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The US Construction Companies is an integrated group of commercial construction firms including US Framing International, US Drywall, US Exteriors, US Development, and US Interiors. Founded in the early 1990s as a single framing operation, the family has grown into a multi-trade powerhouse covering everything from structural framing to finished interiors, serving projects nationwide.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The US Construction Companies traces its roots to the early 1990s, when a small but ambitious wood framing operation set out to do something different in the commercial construction market. Instead of competing solely on price, the founding team competed on reliability, quality, and the ability to deliver what was promised, on time and within budget. That framing operation, which would become US Framing International, earned its reputation one project at a time, building relationships with general contractors and developers who came to depend on the consistency of its work.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">As the framing business grew, a pattern emerged. General contractors who relied on US Framing for their wood framing began asking whether the company could also handle the drywall that naturally followed the framing scope. The logic was straightforward: the company that understood the framing best was ideally positioned to install the drywall and fire-rated assemblies that covered it. That insight led to the creation of US Drywall, and the family model was born.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Over the following decades, the same logic extended to exterior finishes, general contracting, and interior construction. Each new company in the family was created in response to a real market need expressed by the general contractors and developers who were already partnering with the US Family on their projects. The result is not a conglomerate assembled through acquisitions, but an organically grown family of companies that share a common culture, common leadership, and a deep understanding of how their respective trades fit together on a construction project.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">US Framing International: The Foundation</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">US Framing International is the cornerstone of the family and the nation's largest multi-family wood framing group. Headquartered in Pewee Valley, Kentucky, US Framing provides comprehensive wood framing services for commercial and multi-family projects across the entire United States. Our scope extends from pre-design consultation and value engineering through production framing and final quality verification, covering every phase of the wood framing process.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">What distinguishes US Framing from regional framing contractors is scale, technology, and systems. Our national footprint means we have the workforce capacity to staff projects of any size, from 50-unit townhome communities to 1,000-unit multi-phase developments. Our investment in MiTek BIM technology enables us to create detailed three-dimensional framing models that identify coordination issues before they become field problems, reducing RFIs, change orders, and schedule impacts. And our proprietary Job Management Process, or JMP methodology, brings production-level efficiency and quality control to every project regardless of its size or complexity.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">US Framing has framed tens of thousands of multi-family units across the country, establishing a track record of quality, schedule reliability, and cost performance that general contractors and developers have come to depend on. This track record is the foundation upon which the entire US Construction Companies is built.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">US Drywall: Expert Commercial Interior Finishing</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><a href="https://us-drywall.onrender.com" class="text-sky hover:text-sky-dark underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Drywall</a> is the family's commercial drywall and interior finishing arm, providing expert installation of gypsum board systems, metal stud framing, acoustical ceiling systems, and specialty interior finishes for commercial and multi-family projects. US Drywall's scope naturally follows and overlaps with the framing scope, creating a seamless transition from structural framing to interior finishing that eliminates the coordination gaps that typically occur when these scopes are performed by separate companies.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The integration between US Framing and US Drywall delivers tangible benefits to general contractors and building owners. Because both companies operate under shared project management, the transition from framing to drywall proceeds without the scheduling conflicts, scope disputes, and communication breakdowns that commonly occur when independent subcontractors hand off work. Fire-rated assemblies, which span both the framing and drywall scopes, are installed with consistent quality because the same organization is responsible for both the structural framing members and the gypsum board protection that completes the rated assembly.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">US Drywall's capabilities include standard and fire-rated gypsum board installation, metal stud framing for interior partitions, shaft wall systems for elevator and stair enclosures, acoustical ceiling tile and suspension grid installation, exterior gypsum sheathing, and specialty products including moisture-resistant and abuse-resistant board systems. The company serves the same national market as US Framing, maintaining crews and project management resources across the country.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">US Exteriors: Complete Building Envelope Solutions</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><a href="https://us-exteriors.onrender.com" class="text-sky hover:text-sky-dark underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Exteriors</a> completes the building envelope by providing expert installation of siding, roofing, EIFS (Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems), waterproofing, metal panel systems, and exterior trim and soffit. The building envelope is one of the most critical systems in any structure, responsible for keeping water out, maintaining thermal performance, and defining the building's visual identity. US Exteriors brings specialized expertise in all major cladding and roofing systems to ensure this critical system performs as designed.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The connection between framing and exterior finishes is direct and consequential. The quality of the exterior weather barrier, the flatness of the framing substrate, and the accuracy of window and door openings all affect the performance and appearance of the exterior cladding. When US Framing and US Exteriors work together on a project, these interface points are managed by a single organization that takes responsibility for the entire wall assembly from structural framing through finished exterior. This integrated approach eliminates the finger-pointing that often occurs when framing deficiencies affect exterior finish quality, or when exterior finishing contractors discover issues that should have been addressed during framing.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">US Exteriors' service offerings include fiber cement and vinyl siding installation, commercial roofing systems including TPO, EPDM, and modified bitumen, EIFS and stucco systems, waterproofing and moisture management systems, metal panel and composite cladding installation, and exterior trim, soffit, and fascia. Like all members of the US Family, US Exteriors serves projects nationwide with experienced crews and dedicated project management.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">US Development: Turnkey Construction Management</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">US Development represents the family's expansion into general contracting and construction management. While the other family companies serve as specialty trade contractors on projects managed by third-party general contractors, US Development provides turnkey construction management services for developers who want the US Family's integrated approach applied across the entire project, not just the trades the family performs directly.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">US Development leverages the family's deep trade-level expertise to manage all aspects of the construction process, from permitting and site work through final occupancy. The company's project managers bring a hands-on understanding of construction sequencing, trade coordination, and quality control that comes from decades of experience on the trade side of the business. This trade-level perspective enables US Development to identify and resolve construction issues earlier and more effectively than general contractors whose experience is primarily in management rather than production. US Development's services are currently expanding, with a growing portfolio of multi-family and mixed-use projects under management.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">US Interiors: Commercial Interior Finishes</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">US Interiors is the newest member of the US Family, extending the family's capabilities into commercial interior finishing. While US Drywall handles gypsum board and acoustical ceilings, US Interiors focuses on the broader scope of interior construction: finish carpentry, millwork installation, door and hardware installation, flooring, painting, and other interior trades that transform a drywalled space into a finished, occupant-ready environment. US Interiors is currently building its team and capabilities, with an initial focus on multi-family and hospitality projects where the integration with the family's existing framing, drywall, and exterior capabilities provides the greatest value. Details on US Interiors' full service offerings will be available as the company's rollout progresses.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Integrated Advantage: Why One Family Outperforms Many Contractors</h2>

          <!-- AEO Capsule -->
          <div class="bg-sky/5 border-l-4 border-sky rounded-r-lg p-6 my-8">
            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Using an integrated construction family like the US Construction family of companies provides a single point of contact for multiple trades, saves 50 to 100 hours of coordination time per project, compresses construction schedules by 2 to 4 weeks through seamless trade transitions, and offers a unified warranty covering framing through finish rather than separate warranties from multiple subcontractors.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The value of the US Family's integrated model extends far beyond the convenience of dealing with fewer subcontractors. The integration creates measurable benefits in three critical areas: coordination efficiency, schedule performance, and quality accountability.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Coordination efficiency</strong> is the most immediately tangible benefit. On a typical multi-family project, the general contractor spends significant time coordinating between the framing contractor, the drywall contractor, and the exterior contractor: managing scope boundaries, resolving disputes over whose responsibility a particular deficiency is, and synchronizing schedules across independent companies with different priorities and commitments. When these trades are all members of the US Family, that coordination happens internally. Our project managers share information in real time, resolve scope interface issues without involving the general contractor, and maintain a unified schedule that accounts for the dependencies between all of our trades. General contractors working with the US Family consistently report saving 50 to 100 hours of coordination time per project compared to managing these trades independently.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Schedule performance</strong> improves because trade transitions happen seamlessly within the family. When US Framing completes a floor of framing, US Drywall mobilizes immediately because the same project management team is scheduling both scopes. There is no gap between framing completion and drywall start caused by the drywall contractor's availability or their need to remobilize from another project. Similarly, when US Exteriors begins their work on the building envelope, they have real-time access to the framing team's schedule, allowing them to begin work on completed sections while framing continues elsewhere. These seamless transitions compress the overall schedule by two to four weeks on a typical multi-family project, translating directly into earlier occupancy and revenue generation for the developer.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Quality accountability</strong> is perhaps the most important long-term benefit. When a single organization is responsible for the framing, the drywall that covers it, and the exterior that encloses it, there is no ambiguity about who is responsible for quality. If a fire-rated assembly does not meet inspection requirements, the US Family takes responsibility and corrects it, regardless of whether the issue originated in the framing phase or the drywall phase. If an exterior cladding deficiency traces back to a framing substrate issue, the family resolves it internally. This unified accountability eliminates the scope gap disputes that are among the most time-consuming and contentious aspects of managing multiple independent subcontractors, and it gives the general contractor and building owner a single warranty covering the entire scope from framing through finish.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">How It Works: From First Contact to Final Inspection</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Engaging the US Construction family of companies begins with a single conversation. Whether you contact US Framing, US Drywall, or US Exteriors, our team assesses your project's needs and determines which family companies should be involved. For a multi-family project that includes framing, drywall, and exterior scopes, you receive a coordinated proposal from the relevant family companies, developed by project managers who have already discussed your project's specific requirements and identified the optimal approach for each trade.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">During pre-construction, our teams work together to develop an integrated scope plan that clearly defines the boundaries and overlaps between trades, identifies opportunities for value engineering across multiple scopes, and creates a unified schedule that accounts for all trade dependencies. This collaborative pre-construction process often identifies savings that would not be apparent to individual trade contractors working in isolation. For example, framing design decisions that slightly increase the framing cost but significantly reduce drywall labor, or exterior sheathing approaches that simplify both the framing and exterior installation sequences.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">During construction, a single project management team oversees all US Family scopes, providing the general contractor with a unified point of contact for progress updates, schedule coordination, and issue resolution. Our field supervisors communicate directly with each other, addressing interface issues in real time without the delays inherent in multi-company communication chains. Quality control inspections at trade transition points, such as the framing-to-drywall handoff and the framing-to-exterior handoff, are conducted by our internal quality team, ensuring that each subsequent trade receives a substrate that meets their installation requirements.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Real-World Impact: What GCs and Developers Experience</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The benefits of the integrated family model are not theoretical. General contractors and developers who have worked with the US Family consistently report three outcomes. First, reduced coordination overhead: with one family handling multiple trades, the general superintendent spends less time in coordination meetings and more time managing the overall project. Second, fewer disputes: scope boundary issues that would normally require general contractor intervention are resolved internally within the family, keeping the focus on production rather than conflict resolution. Third, better-quality trade transitions: because the same organization manages both sides of every trade handoff, the incoming trade always receives work that meets their starting requirements, eliminating the rework and remediation that often accompanies trade transitions between independent contractors.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">For developers, the integrated model also simplifies the contracting and procurement process. Instead of qualifying, negotiating with, and contracting multiple independent subcontractors for the framing, drywall, and exterior scopes, the developer or their general contractor works with one family. Insurance requirements, safety programs, and project management systems are consistent across all family companies, reducing the administrative burden associated with onboarding multiple subcontractors.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">The Future: Expanding Nationwide, Adding Capabilities</h2>

            <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-sky uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">Quick Answer</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The US Construction Companies is expanding its nationwide footprint and adding new capabilities through US Development for turnkey construction management and US Interiors for commercial interior finishes. The family's goal is to offer a complete framing-through-finish solution for multi-family and commercial projects anywhere in the United States.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The US Construction Companies continues to grow, both geographically and in the breadth of services offered. US Framing International already operates nationwide, and the other family companies are progressively extending their reach to match. The goal is straightforward: to make the integrated family model available to general contractors and developers on every multi-family and commercial project in the United States, regardless of location.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">The expansion of US Development into general contracting and construction management opens new opportunities for the family to apply its integrated approach at the project level, not just the trade level. And the launch of US Interiors will complete the family's ability to deliver a true framing-through-finish scope, covering every major trade from the first wall panel to the last coat of paint.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Throughout this growth, the principles that built the US Family remain unchanged: deliver what we promise, coordinate internally so our partners do not have to, and treat every project as an opportunity to demonstrate that an integrated family of construction companies can outperform a collection of independent subcontractors. That commitment has driven the family's success for over three decades, and it will continue to guide our growth for decades to come.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-navy mt-10 mb-4">Get Started with the US Construction family of companies</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Whether your project needs framing only, framing and drywall, a complete exterior envelope, or the full framing-through-finish scope, the US Construction family of companies is ready to partner with you. Contact any member of the family to begin the conversation, and we will assemble the right team for your project's specific needs. One call starts the process. One family delivers the result.</p>
